Molscale is a scale I am working on that will 'directly' measure mols from a specified chemical compound. 

In order to do this, the software in this repo will be used on a Raspberry Pi that is connected to a touchscreen monitor with an hx711 module + a 1kg load cell. 

Once finished, the load cell/hx711 combo will directly input the mass of whatever is on the scale into the Mol Calculator that is already finished, the user must select which elements are in the compound they are measuring, and they will see the calculated value of mols in an entry box after they press the calculate button.
